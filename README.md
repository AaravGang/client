# Online Games (better title soon)

Online Tic Tac Toe and Connect4.

## Setup
If you dont have python3.8 installed, then go to [a link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install `python3.8.1`

Once you have that, download this client folder's zip on your `Desktop` and unzip it.

Next, Open a new terminal or command prompt, and paste in the following commands:
```
cd Desktop/client
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

👆🏻 This will switch your current directory to the client folder, and install the dependencies required to play the game.


## Usage

### Run the server:
`cd server/`

`python3.8 server.py`

### Run the clients ( from any computer on your WIFI! )
1) Send the client folder to the computer you wanna run it on.
2) Open a new terminal tab and run the following commands to run the client GUI

`cd client/`

`python3.8 client.py`

The client will ask for a server IP address to connect to, get the IP address of the server and paste it in, and you'll be good to go!
