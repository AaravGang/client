# Online Games (better title soon)

Online Tic Tac Toe and Connect4.

## Setup
If you dont have python3.8 installed, then go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install `python3.8.1`

Once you have that, download this client folder's zip on your `Desktop` and unzip it. (It will prolly be named `client-main`, rename it to `client`)

Next, Open a new terminal or command prompt, and paste in the following commands:
```
cd Desktop/client
python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

👆🏻 This will switch your current directory to the client folder, and install the dependencies required to play the game.


## Play the game

### Run the `client.py` file by:
```
python3.8 client.py
```

The client will ask for the server's details, paste them in, and you'll be good to go!
