# Online Games (better title soon)

Online Tic Tac Toe and Connect4.

## Setup

If you dont have python3 installed, then go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install `python3.8` or `python3.9`. cuz I'm not sure if it'll work on other versions.

Once you have that, download this client folder's zip on your `Desktop` and unzip it. (It will prolly be named `client-main`, rename it to `client`)

Next, Open a new terminal or command prompt, and paste in the following commands:

```
cd Desktop/client
python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

üëÜüèª This will switch your current directory to the client folder, and install the dependencies required to play the game.

## Play the game

### Run the `client.py` file by:

`python3 client.py` on mac
OR
`python client.py` on windows

The client will ask for the server's details, paste them in (right click), and you'll be good to go!
